The license I have decided to use for this is the standard MIT license. This makes it so that the files are highly reusable. To install you will just need an ESP 32, LDR, switch, (no longer need a potentiometer), the resistors, breadboard, and cables. You will also need processing and arduino on your computer. First run the sensors to serials created by our professor in arduino, to connect the ESP32 to your computer. Then run the processing sketch to start the main program.
